# Title : Analysis, Estimation and forecasting of sales reources for a bank based on thier existing productivity.
This project aims to use DataScience methodologies to analyse a bank's dataset, examine the productivity of existing resources and suggest a branch wise schematic for the resources to be hired

in order to achive a defined sales target in a fixed duration.

The code is spread in to 4 sections :

+ Data analysis and wrangling
+ Algorithm for suggesting the estimated resources
+ Choropleth map to highlight the resource requirement across states
+ Forecasting algorithm to forecast productivity of new resources
